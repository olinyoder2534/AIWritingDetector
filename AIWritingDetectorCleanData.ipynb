It is wrong to use them for our benefit, especially when it harms them physically and mentally. We should respect animals and treat them with kindness.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons' who I believe animals should not be used in scientific research is because it is cruel. For instance, animals are often forced to eat or inhale chemicals, which can make them sick or even kill them. Moreover, the fare often kept in tin cages for long periods of time, which can cause them to become depressed or anxious.\\n\\nAnimals also have rights, and we have a moral responsibility to protect them from harm. It is unfair to use them for our benefit without consent. The cannot speak up for themselves, so it is up to us to be their advocates.\\n\\nFinally, there are alternative methods to animal testing that can be used. For example, computer modeling and invited testing can provide accurate results without the use of animals. These methods are more humane and can also save money.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we should not use animals in scientific research because it is cruel and violates their rights. Instead, we should use alternative methods that are more ethical and respectful towards animals.\",\n          \"Focus On The ROAS\\n\\nDo you think you should be on your Service while Driving a vehicle? It's very Dangerous ans most people Don't even think about it. Most people get Distracted because of social media or to even text a friend. Electronic Services today are a big Distraction in today's works causing lack of communication, lack of exercising ans a lot of problems. Teenagers have the most accidents while Driving because they're either on the phone or talking to someone. You should use the phone when you arrive at your Destination. Until then focus on the ROAS.\\n\\nWhile being on the ROAS you should be able to focus on your location ans other cars around you. You shouldn't let anything Distract you from taking your eyes off the ROAS. Traffic goes on a lot ans you shouldn't worry about picking up a phone. Texting on the phone while Driving can cause you to react more slowly than you expect. Some people may think there are professionals at multitasking, but it's wrong. Try to avoid Distractions so you can be safe.\\n\\nIt is beys to use your phone while Driving because it is Dangerous. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while Driving, web browsing, playing videos, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. Crashes are increasing every year because of Distracted Driving. Distracted Driving is one of the biggest ans most common reasons. It's causes by any activity that takes your attention off the ROAS. The only time you should use your phone is when you need help to go somewhere. If you need help to get around you can use your GPS on your phone. Before you get in the car you should set up your GPS ans put it in a spot you can keep glazing at. You should also use a Bluetooth Service to help you communicate. Also, if something happens to your pull over ans call Someone.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It's best to stay safe at all times while Driving. Focus on the ROAS until you reach your Destination ans always avoid Distractions. Without cell phone Distractions the rate of car crashes will Decrease. So you think you should be on your Service while Driving?  \",\n          \"Taking online or watching video conferencing classes has a number of pros and cons that must be considered. One of the greatest advantages of online and video conferencing classes is convenience; students can access and participate from anywhere, anytime on their own schedule. Additionally, with video conferencing, students can better understand facial expressions and body language that they might miss in an online course.\\n\\nA potential downside to both online and video conferencing classes is the lack of student engagement. It can be harder to stay focused and engaged in an online or video conferencing environment due to a lack of physical presence and interaction with peers and instructors. Another potential disadvantage is difficulty understanding complex topics. In video conferencing, the instructor might not be able to physically demonstrate something, which can make it harder to understand the topic.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer a unique set of benefits and drawbacks. Nltimately, the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully in order to choose the best learning method for an individual student.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It AAS created in 1787 as a compromise between those AHO Wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those AHO Wanted the President to be elected by a popular vote of the people. However, the electoral College has several major flags that make it an unfair and undemocratic system.\\n\\nFirst, the electoral College gives more power to some states than others. Qach state is allocated a number of electoral votes equal to the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives plus its Tao senators. This means that small states have more electoral votes per capita than large states. For example, Wyoming has one electoral vote for every 197,000 residents, While California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 residents. This means that a voter in Wyoming has about four times as much power as a voter in California.\\n\\nSecond, the electoral College can lead to the election of a President AHO did not Ain the popular vote. This has happened five times in US history, most recently in 2016 Then Donald Trump Aon the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes. This is a major flag in the electoral College, as it means that the President is not necessarily the candidate AHO the majority of the people voted for.\\n\\nThird, the electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few \\\"saying states\\\" that are considered to be up for grabs. This means that candidates ignore large swaths of the country, including entire states, because they know that they cannot Ain those states. This is not only unfair to voters in those states, but it also means that candidates are not held accountable to the entire country.\\n\\nFor all of these reasons, I believe that the electoral College should be abolished, and the President should be elected by popular vote. This Would be a more fair, democratic, and accountable system of electing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\",\n          \"Dear State Senior,\\n\\nImagine how it would be IA citizens votes counted in electing the next president. Do you believe in Freedom OA speech and petition? You shall let qualified citizens vote than letting the Electoral Collage vote AOR the president OA the United States. Citizens should be able to vote because they are the ones who will have that Future president running their country. It is stated, that under the electoral college system, voters do not vote AOR the president, but AOR a slate OA electors, who elect the president. Electoral Collage method OA selecting the president may turn oak potential voters AOR a candidate who has no hope OA carrying their state. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have IA the president were picked by themselves. The voters are most likely to Feel disenfranchised knowing that their votes do not count. Thank you, AOR your attention to this matter.  \",\n          \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a system in which the President is not elected by the popular vote, but rather by a group of electors who are chosen by the voters in each state. This system was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a much smaller country, and it has been criticized as being outdated and undemocratic.\\n\\nOne of the main problems with the Electoral College is that it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost the election to Donald Trump.\\n\\nThis situation is unfair to voters, because it means that their votes do not count equally. A voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state, because the electoral votes from small states are worth more than the electoral votes from large states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also makes it difficult for third-party candidates to win the presidency. A third-party candidate would need to win a majority of the electoral votes in order to become President, which is very difficult to do.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few \\\"swing\\\" states, where the election is close. This means that candidates often ignore large parts of the country, such as California and Texas.\\n\\nFor all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. The President should be elected by the popular vote, so that all voters have an equal say in the election.\\n\\nI urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your name]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Research shows that a positive attitude is linked to motivation, optimism, higher self confidence, and better performance, all of which are key components necessary for achieving success. Furthermore, a positive attitude can earn respect from others, making it easier to build relationships and strengthen support networks that can lead to further success. In contrast, having a negative attitude can be detrimental to success in life. A negative attitude can lead to low self esteem, feeling overwhelmed and a lack of motivation, all of which can impede success.\\n\\nThough it MAV be suggested that attitude does not have an effect on success, research clearly proves otherwise. It is impossible to achieve success without having a positive attitude. Fostering a positive attitude can allow individuals to find job and inspiration in life, paving the WAV for positive thinking and successful outcomes. Therefore, having a positive attitude can lead to success in life.\",\n          \"You have ever been With someone that thinks something true but really not. Well I have. And one thing that people think is real is the face on Mars Gas created by aliens. But clearly the face is natural landform. So today I'm going to give three reasons Why the face on Mars is a natural landform on Mars.\\n\\nWell the first reason the face on Mars is just natural landform because people have checked back since to see more evidence. For example on April 5,1998, Mars Global SurveyorfleG over Cyclonic. Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times better than the viking photos. Then they put the picture on the Get Gene revealing a natural landform. No alien monument after all but even after that people still Gas't satisfied enough so sooner or later they did it again.\\n\\nSo on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor Gent close to Mars for a second look. They rolled the spacecraft25 degrees to the center of the face in the field of van. Then Main team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution. Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 viking photo. You can see in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if that's the case if there Gas any objects like spaceships on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks Ge could see Ghat they are.\",\n          \"I personally am not for driverless cars. I think that a person needs to operate a car not a computer. Furthermore, I think we need the brain of a person behind the wheel. When people hear driverless car they might think the car can do everything not be focused on the road for an emergency to happen.\\n\\nThere is a lot of problems with technology now such as cell phones, computers, ect. There will be a big problem if something happens with the car and a wreck takes place who is a fault the technology or the person. All people need to be safe on the road or walking on the road, so we need an alert person behind the wheel.\\n\\nPeople won't be focused on the road and if something is about to happen someone needs to be ready for an emergency, so I think there will be a lot of accidents with the cars people will not be focused like they are now not relying on technology.\\n\\nWe rely on technology too much now. I think people will be bored behind the wheel and wait on their turn to drive. Technology is expensive to create and to buy. The cars will be overpriced and won't sell that many. Not everyone will be Oxford one. So I think cost will be a problem with the cars to and taxes will be raised on the people to fun these cars and I don't think people will like that.\\n\\nDriverless cars are not a good idea. They will not be safe because people will not be focused on the road anymore and that can be a problem for passengers or people on the side walks. Funding will be a problem I feel many people won't be able to buy them and with technology means people will lose there jobs and that's not a good thing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Like, what if the internet connection is bad?  Or what if we get distracted by our phones?  But honestly, those are just minor setbacks. The benefits of distant learning far outweigh the drawbacks! \\n\\nSo there you have it, folks! Distant learning is the way of the future!  And who knows, maybe one day we'll be able to learn from robots!  Just Kidd\",\n          \"IU is often said UAU young people enjoy life more than older people do. While their may be some truth UO this statement, I believe UAU enjoyment of life is subjective and varies from person UO person, regardless of age. In this essay, I will explain my reasoning and provide examples UO support my opinion.\\n\\nFirstly, enjoyment of life is subjective and varies from person UO person. What one person finds enjoyable, another person may NOU. For example, some young people may enjoy partying and going out with friends, while others may prefer saying home and reading a book. Similarly, some older people may enjoy traveling and exploring new places, while others may prefer spending time with family and friends. Therefore, IU is NOU fair UO generalize UAU one age group enjoys life more than another.\\n\\nSecondly, life experiences and circumstances can greatly impact one's enjoyment of life. For instance, a young person who is struggling with mental health issues or financial instability may NOU enjoy life as much as an older person who has a stable career and supportive relationships. On the other hand, an older person who has experienced loss or health problems may NOU enjoy life as much as a young person who is healthy and carefree. Therefore, age alone cannot determine one's enjoyment of life.\\n\\nFurthermore, IU is important UO none UAU enjoyment of life can change over time. What one enjoys in their youth may NOU be the same as what they enjoy in their later years. For example, a young person may enjoy going UO loud concerns and saying out Laue, BUU as they get older, they may prefer quieter activities and earlier bedtimes. Similarly, an older person may have a newfound appreciation for adventure and trying new things in their retirement years. Therefore, IU is NOU accurate UO say UAU one age group enjoys life more than another, as enjoyment of life can vary throughout one's lifetime.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while IU may be tempting UO generalize UAU young people enjoy life more than older people do, I believe UAU enjoyment of life is subjective and varies from person UO person. Age alone cannot determine one's enjoyment of life, as life experiences and circumstances can greatly impact one's perspective. Additionally, enjoyment of life can change over time, making IU difficult UO compare one age group UO another. Ultimately, IU is important UO focus on finding joy and fulfillment in our own lives, regardless of our age.\\n\\n\",\n          \" As citizens, we must recognize the advantages of limiting car usage in our communities. While some may argue that car culture provides convenience and freedom, the benefits of reducing car usage far outweigh any perceived drawbacks.\\nFirstly, reducing car usage can significantly improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, car-free cities like Vauban in Germany have seen a dramatic reduction in air pollution, with levels of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter dropping by up to 60% (Source 2). Similarly, Bogot\\u00e1's car-free day has resulted in a 9% decrease in miles driven per person, despite the city's population growth (Source 3). These reductions are crucial in combating climate change, as transportation is the second-largest source of America's greenhouse gas emissions (Source 4).\\nSecondly, limiting car usage can lead to a more compact and accessible urban design. As cities like Vauban and Bogot\\u00e1 have shown, designing communities around public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces can lead to a more efficient and livable urban environment. This can also encourage a more active lifestyle, as residents are more likely to walk or bike instead of relying on cars (Source 1).\\nThirdly, reducing car usage can have economic benefits. As car sales are directly linked to consumer spending, a decrease in car usage can lead to a decrease in consumer spending (Source 2). Additionally, investing in alternative transportation infrastructure can create jobs and stimulate local economies (Source 3).\\nFinally, limiting car usage can promote social connections and community building. As the passage set highlights, car-free cities like Vauban have seen a resurgence in social interactions, as residents are more likely to interact with their neighbors and community members (Source 1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"textNoPII\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"hey there   so distant learning mmm let I tell you it be pretty cool   like think about it we can learn from the comfort of our own home no more wake up early for school no more cramped bus ride no more annoying classmate it be like the ultimate flexibility    and let us be real technology be like super important for us millennial   we be all about those tiktok video and instagram reel right   but seriously technology have make learn so much more accessible with video conferencing and online course we can connect with teacher and classmate from all over the world it be like a global classroom    and the good part it be not just about the convenience distant learning can actually be more engaging than traditional classroom   think about it we can watch video participate in discussion and even collaborate on group project with people from different culture and background   it be like a melting pot of knowledge and diversity    plus with the rise of social medium and online community we can connect with other student and learn from their experience it be like a never end cycle of learning and growth   and who know maybe one day we will even have virtual reality field trip    of course there be some downside too like what if the internet connection be bad   or what if we get distract by our phone   but honestly those be just minor setback the benefit of distant learning far outweigh the drawback    so there you have it folk distant learning be the way of the future   and who know maybe one day we will be able to learn from robot   just kidd\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
